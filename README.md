## Description

This provides a mechanism to configure [Lumberjack](https://github.com/jonathanstowe/Lumberjack)

This is a fairly simple generic configuration, if you want more sophistication you may want to
compose your configuration in code.

Somewhat more detail can be found in the [Documentation](Documentation.md).
